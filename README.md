Cryptosquare Message Encoder
==========

By Ashlin Aronin & Jordan Johansen, 8-Sep-2015

Encode secret messages using a square code.

Description from Epicodus:
A classic method for composing secret messages is called a square code.

The spaces and punctuation are removed from the English text and the characters are written into a square (or rectangle) and the entire message is downcased. For example, the sentence "don't compare yourself to others, compare yourself to the person you were yesterday" is 69 characters long, so it is written into a rectangle with 8 rows and 9 columns.
<pre>
dontcompa
reyoursel
ftoothers
compareyo
urselftot
hepersony
ouwereyes
terday
</pre>

The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to right. For example, the message above is coded as:
<pre>
drfcu hotoe toreu enyom
spwrt oopee edcuta lrram
rhrfs eymse etoype ryone
alsot ys
</pre>
